Introduction to Recursion in Python

All recursive algorithms must obey three important laws:

1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.

Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of a problem.
It is often elegant for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems, 
but each recursive call uses the call stack, which can cost additional memory.
