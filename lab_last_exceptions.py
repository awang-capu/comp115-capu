Introduction to Exceptions in Python

In Python, exceptions are errors that occur during program execution. 
They allow your program to handle unexpected situations gracefully 
instead of crashing.

Benefits of using exceptions:
1. Keeps your program running even when an error occurs.
2. Separates normal code from error-handling code, making it cleaner and easier to read.
3. Provides detailed information about what went wrong, which can help with debugging.
4. Encourages robust and maintainable code by forcing you to think about potential errors and how to handle them.
