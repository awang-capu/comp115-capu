Exam Preparation Exercises (Optional, but highly recommended)


Objective:
1. Review the function 
2. Review the conditionals (if-else)
3. Review the program flow (for/while - continue, break)
4. Practice when to use and how to operate on the collection data types: 
tuple, list, string, set, dictionary.
6. Review the accumulator algorithm pattern (Initialize-Loop-Return):
   Initialize a variable (accumulator) that is assigned to an integer, a list, etc. 
   Loop (for or while) to update the variable based on requirements; 
   Return the variable.

Exercise 9 - Coding question

Write a function named "exist_in_both" that takes two strings as input 
and returns the number of characters that occur in both strings.
You can assume that all characters within a string are unique (no repeats).

For example, 
if the function is passed "lap" and "help", 
the function exist_in_both("lap","help") will return 2,
because the characters "l" and "p" occur in both strings.

For example,
exist_in_both("computer","mute") wil return 4.

Design and pass your own unit tests.

Exercise 10 - Coding question

If both adjacent letters in a word are the same, 
we call the two adjacent letters are "good neighbors".

E.g.1, there are one pair of good neighbors inside the word "apple",
since word[1] == word[2], and they are both 'p'.

E.g.2, there are two pairs of good neighbors inside the word "occurrence",
since word[1] == word[2], and they are both 'c'; 
word[4] == word[5], and they are both 'r'.

E.g.3, there are two pairs of good neighbors inside the word "hmmm",
since word[1] == word[2], and they are both 'm'; 
word[2] == word[3], and they are both 'm'.


Write a function called "good_neighbors" that accepts a word as input, 
and return the number of pairs of good_neighbors. 
Assume that all the letters in the word are lowercase letters, 
and there are at least two letters in the word.

For example, good_neighbors("happy") will return 1, 
since there is one pair of adjacent letters 'p'.

good_neighbors("occurrence") will return 2, 
since there are twp pairs of adjacent letters, 'c' and 'r'.

word_example = "arrrrhhh"
good_neighbors(word_example) will return 5, since
word_example[1] == word_example[2], both 'r'
word_example[2] == word_example[3], both 'r'
word_example[3] == word_example[4], both 'r'
word_example[5] == word_example[6], both 'h'
word_example[6] == word_example[7], both 'h'


Hint:

We may compare each letter word[i] with its neighbor word[i + 1], 
while traversing the word using index i. Use the accumulator algorithm pattern.

"""
Exercise 11 - Coding question

Implement a function called "more_than_2" that accepts a list of strings as input. 
The function identifies strings that occur more than two times in the list,
and return these strings as a list. 

Eg.1, fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "apple", "pear", "orange",
"banana", "banana", "watermelon"] 
more_than_2(fruits) will return ["apple","banana"]. 

Eg.2, colors = ["red", "red", "yellow", "green", "red", "yellow", "orange",
"green", "banana", "yellow"] 
more_than_2(colors) will return ["red", "yellow"]. 

Hint: Utilize dict data type to count the occurrences for each string, 
then traverse all the keys in the dict and compares its value to 3. 
Use the accumulator algorithm pattern.
